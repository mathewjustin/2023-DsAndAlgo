When to use DP?

1.The problem can be broken down into "overlapping subproblems" - smaller versions of the original problem that are re-used multiple times
2.The problem has an "optimal substructure" - an optimal solution can be formed from optimal solutions to the overlapping subproblems of the original problem



The first characteristic that is common in DP problems is that the problem will ask for the optimum value (maximum or minimum) of something, or the number of ways there are to do something. For example:

* What is the minimum cost of doing...
* What is the maximum profit from...
* How many ways are there to do...
* What is the longest possible...
* Is it possible to reach a certain point...



The second characteristic that is common in DP problems is that future "decisions" depend on earlier decisions.
Deciding to do something at one step may affect the ability to do something in a later step.
This characteristic is what makes a greedy algorithm invalid for a DP problem - we need to factor in results from previous decisions. Admittedly,
this characteristic is not as well defined as the first one, and the best way to identify it is to go through some examples.
