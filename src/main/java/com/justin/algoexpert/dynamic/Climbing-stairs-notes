For Climbing Stairs, let's say we have an function dp
dp where dp(i) returns the number of ways to climb to the ith
step. Solving the original problem would be as easy as return dp(n)

A recurrence relation to transition between states.

A recurrence relation is an equation that relates different states with each other.
Let's say that we needed to find how many ways we can climb to the 30th stair.
Well, the problem states that we are allowed to take either 1 or 2 steps at a time.
Logically, that means to climb to the 30th stair, we arrived from either the 28th or 29th stair.
Therefore, the number of ways we can climb to the 30th stair is equal to the number of ways we can climb to the 28th stair plus the number of ways we can climb to the 29th stair.

The problem is, we don't know how many ways there are to climb to the 28th or 29th stair.
However, we can use the logic from above to define a recurrence relation. In this case,
dp(i) = dp(i - 1) + dp(i - 2)
dp(i) = dp(i - 1) + dp(i - 2)
//This is actually fibinocci number in disguise.

=============================================================
Base cases, so that our recurrence relation doesn't go on infinitely.

The equation
dp(i) = dp(i - 1) + dp(i - 2)
dp(i) = dp(i - 1) + dp(i - 2) on its own will continue forever to negative infinity.
We need base cases so that the function will eventually return an actual number.

Finding the base cases is often the easiest part of solving a DP problem,
and just involves a little bit of logical thinking. When coming up with the base case(s) ask yourself:
What state(s) can I find the answer to without using dynamic programming? In this example,
we can reason that there is only 1 way to climb to the first stair (1 step once), and there are 2 ways to climb to the second stair (1 step twice and 2 steps once).
Therefore, our base cases are
 dp(1) = 1 and
 dp(2) = 2.
